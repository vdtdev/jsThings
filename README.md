========

I have/continue to make small JavaScript programs for various purposes; some to be used in webpages-- others just to automate tasks. Anything that I think
might have a chance of being reusable I will stick here.

### Webpage Scripts ###

`jstDomModTl.js` contains a class that takes an element id for it's constructor. It has methods to check/modify/set the CSS position of the element

`\java\jvanilla\jvanilla.html' is a simple Java class generator that generates a class with the specified private fields, getters, setters, and constructor
